# Line-Following-Car
A line following car using pic microcontroller 16f877a
I designed and developed a line following car using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This project involved creating an autonomous vehicle capable of detecting and following a predefined path using sensors and motor control.

Skills Gained:
Sensor Integration and Calibration (IR Sensors)
Microcontroller Programming (PIC16F877A)
Motor Control and PWM Techniques
Chassis Design and Assembly
Real-time Navigation Algorithms
Testing, Calibration, and Performance Optimization
